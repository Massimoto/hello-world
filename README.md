# hello-world
This are my first stepst on github
My name is Massimiliano Bennici. I immigrated last summer from Hamburg, Germany to Miami. I have 16 years of work experience, mainly in Sales Manager positions abroad. I am looking for a career change and as I am very computer and online savy I started researching which opportunities I have to learn it. I found some bootcamp programms here in Miami, which are very very expensive. As I am looking for my first job in U.S.A., the bootcamp option is not for me right now. After doing more research, I found out that I could start learning coding myself. So I started 10 days ago with codecademy and a couple of days after I found teamtreehouse.com. As I am fan of tutorials, teamtreehouse is my favorite choice and I signed up for a memebership. I am learning now every day minimum 2 hours and read a lot about the tech industry and community and soon I want to start attending local meetups. It feels like this new way, is the right one for me. I am very motivated and eager to lern more every day. Hopefully I remain self-motivated to learn every day, my target is to start to apply for a tech job in September 2016 or to attend a bootcamp in october.
